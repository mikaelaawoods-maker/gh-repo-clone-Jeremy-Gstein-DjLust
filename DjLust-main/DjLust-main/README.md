# DjLust
A Simple WoW Addon to Play music and display an animation during Bloodlust and other similar spells.

## Combat 'state' tracked using players haste relative % by sampling every 0.3 seconds. 

# Usage:

*   Click the new bloodlust icon on your minimap to bring up settings menu OR use the following commands
*   `/djlust` **OR alias:** `/djl`

## Known Limitations:

not exclusively checking bloodlust. we are only checking if our haste went up by 25% in last 0.3 seconds. therefore spells like pres evoker tip of scales will trigger the music.
